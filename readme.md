## SrcClient
This repo provides some sample clients that may be helpful in connecting to the [sourcemap.com](http://www.sourcemap.com) API. There is a read/write client for working with supply chains as native PHPObjects and a client for accessing the read API in javascript with jsonp.

## Sourcemap API Wiki
You can also access the [Sourcemap API Wiki](supplychainstudies/SrcClient/wiki), which provides information on how to access and utilize the API.
